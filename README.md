### 1. **Project Overview:**

The **Smart Health Monitoring System** is a portable and efficient device designed to monitor vital health parameters—**heart rate and body temperature**—in real time. The system not only displays these values on an LCD screen but also evaluates the **Health Risk Score**, providing users with a visual indication of their health status using **LED indicators**. This project aims to integrate basic health monitoring with a dynamic, easy-to-understand **risk assessment system**.
